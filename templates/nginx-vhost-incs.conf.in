    # this file presents as a sample for Nginx master Web server to include
    # virtual hosting Web Servers.  We are not using this file in any buildout
    # config file.
    # 
    # Normally, just copy this to etc folder, and the master server's config
    # will pick it up.  This is set up in buildout nginx-master.cfg under 
    # settings key: nginx-vhost-incs-file.
